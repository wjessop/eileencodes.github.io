<p>Around the beginning of the year I decided to watch every Railscast tutorial. I know what you're thinking &mdash; that this was a "New Year's Resolution". Well that's simply not true. It just appears to be one. I resolved to do that way before the New Year, it just so happened that on January 3rd is when I had time to start.</p>
<p>Well some people have said, why watch every one? They are old and from 2007 and some aren't relevant anymore. That may be true, but at <a href="http://www.evolvingmedia.net" target="_blank">EMN</a> we have some legacy Rails sites that I didn't build but might have to one day fix, and it helps to know what has changed from Rails 2 to Rails 3, etc.</p>
<p>I've also learned some really great things and tips. One in particular is the footnote plugin for textmate which links the error messages in Rails to where they appear in your code. In your footer it also describes the SQl calls &amp; queries, and analyzes the speed, shows the CSS and HTML and everything you might want to inspect for that code. The video that describes it is "<a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/24-the-stack-trace?view=asciicast" target="_blank">The Stack Trace</a>" and although the method for installing the plugin shown in the video no longer works you can download it from <a href="https://github.com/josevalim/rails-footnotes" target="_blank">github</a> and follow the installation instructions there. It needs to be installed for each app and added to your <code>.gitignore</code> because this plugin should only be used in development mode.</p>
<p>Happy coding!</p>
