  <h3>About</h3>
  <p>Hi, I'm Eileen! I'm a programmer at <a href='http://basecamp.com' target='_blank'>Basecamp</a> (formerly 37signals) on the Security and Performance team. I'm an avid contributor to Open Source and am on the Rails Committers Team and the Rails Security Team. I enjoy speaking at conferences, usually about performance or contributing to Open Source. Outside code, I enjoy craft beer and hiking with my husband, <a href='http://twitter.com/abeuchitelle' target='_blank'>Abe</a> and our dog, <a href='http://twitter.com/aryadog' target='_blank'>Arya</a>.</p>
