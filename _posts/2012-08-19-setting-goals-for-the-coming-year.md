<p>Every year at <a href="http://www.evolvingmedia.net" target="_blank">EMN</a> we do performance evaluations sometime during the summer. Generally, they are pretty straight forward, but a question I was asked got me thinking;</p>
<h3>"Where do I want to be in a year?"</h3>
<p>Every year I amaze myself with the amount I've learned in the past year. But I've always done so without setting trackable goals where I can actually see my progress throughout the year. I personally find New Year's resolutions to be contrived and most give up because they set goals that don't have manageable steps. Changing oneself &ndash; whether that be on a personal or professional level &ndash; takes time.</p>
<p>Here are my manageable goals for the year:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make this blog better - mostly under the hood stuff. I am working on currently adding a sitemap , pretty permalinks, rss and fixing up my 400 &amp; 500 pages. Also, want to add photos, pages, comments fleshing out the admin to be more of a CMS that I can distribute on a small scale.</li>
<li>Improve the testing on the blog (I have tests but not for everything and I want to get better at TDD by increasing my code coverage)</li>
<li>Finish the <a href="http://rubykoans.com/" target="_blank">Ruby Koans</a> to improve my TDD (by the way, Ruby Koans are awesome and I'm about 1/3 of the way to enlightenment)</li>
<li>Contribute to at least 2 open source projects and release at least 1 open source project.</li>
<li>Continue doing what I'm doing &mdash; learning new languages/frameworks, building awesome web applications, I'd like to spend more time with Sinatra, Emberjs, Backbonejs, RubyMotion, etc</li>
<li>Don't forget to have fun and ensure I maintain a healthy work/life balance</li>
<li>Write more in this blog. I've been writing at least once a month but I can do better since I'm learning new things</li>
</ul>
<p>So, there you have it. My goals for the year. I'm sure they'll change, but now I can track my progress on my yearly goals.</p>
<p>I encourage you to create your own development goals for the year and at the end of the year determine whether you have reached or exceeded your goals.</p>
